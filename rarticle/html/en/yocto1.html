  <p><h3>Yocto - Linux Embedded Serie 1.</h3></p>
  <p>Hi.</p>
  <p>Today I'm going to start talking about the Yocto Project.</p>
  <p>The Yocto project defines itself as "not an embedded Linux distribution, but one that creates a custom Linux distribution for you".</p>
  <p>Well, I'll talk about that definition and a lot more along this serie of articles, but for now let's start with the basics.</p>
  <p>First of all, what components does an Embedded Linux distribution need to have?</p>
  <p>Check out the following list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Toolchain: a collection of tools used to create (compile, link, etc) the binaries that will run on you target Linux distribution.</li>
    <li>Boot Loader: a program that loads the Linux system on a target device.</li>
    <li>Kernel: the main component of the Linux system.</li>
    <li>Root Filesystem: all the files that a Linux system needs to operate or to do its job.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That's it for now.</p>
  <p>I'll expand on all of these topics in future articles.</p>
  <p>See you!</p>
  <p>[]s</p>
