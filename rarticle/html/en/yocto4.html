  <p><h3>Yocto - Linux Embedded Series 4.</h3></p>
  <p>Hi.</p>
  <p>This is the fourth article of this series.</p>
  <p>You can find the first one <a href="http://{{.Host}}/{{.Lang}}/yocto1">here</a>.</p>
  <p>In the <a href="http://{{.Host}}/{{.Lang}}/yocto3">last</a> article, I talked about setting up a build machine.</p>
  <p>Now, it's time to talk about the poky project.</p>
  <p>So, what is poky?</p>
  <p>Poky is known as a reference distribution of the Yocto project.</p>
  <p>That is, it's a template for building a custom Linux system.</p>
  <p>It contains projects like BitBake, OpenEmbedded Core, and Metadata that guides us in the process of building a custom Linux system.</p>
  <p>I'll describe all of these other projects in turn, but here let's see how to get started with poky.</p>
  <p>First of all, we need to clone the poky code and execute it in our build machine.</p>
  <p>Basically this:</p>
  <p><code>git clone http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky</code></p>
  <p><code>cd pody</code></p>
  <p><code>git fetch --tags</code></p>
  <p><code>git checkout tags/yocto-3.2</code></p>
  <p>Note that I'm using a specific branch here, ok?</p>
  <p>I'm going to use the "default" target here. It's the easiest way to get started. After you get the basic idea of how Yocto works, you can try more advanced ones.</p>
  <p><code>source oe-init-build-env</code></p>
  <p><code>bitbake core-image-minimal</code></p>
  <p>Now you should have an image that you can run on your our computer. Of course, you're going to run it through <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>, which is an emulator.</p>
  <p><code>runqemu qemux86</code></p>
  <p>After some seconds you should see a device running like it was an embedded device.</p>
  <p>That's it.</p>
  <p>In the next article, I'll talk about Metadata.</p>
  <p>Stay tuned!</p>
