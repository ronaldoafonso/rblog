  <p><h3>Cloud Computing - My First Impression</h3></p>
  <p>Hi, I just got started in the Cloud Computing world!</p>
  <p>Well, of course, as a DevOps engineer not as a user of the cloud since it has been out there for a long time.</p>
  <p>I started reading about AWS, and soon I came across a service known as S3.</p>
  <p>Long story short, S3 is storage in the cloud.</p>
  <p>You can create, copy, move, and delete data from your computer to S3 and the other way around.</p>
  <p>So, it's all very interesting ... but what really got my attention was the fact that when you're using the cloud it looks pretty much as if you were doing things in a local environment.</p>
  <p>For example, to copy a file from my computer to S3 I just need to run an: "aws s3 cp" command.</p>
  <p>Check it out: aws s3 cp file.txt s3://ronaldoafonso</p>
  <p>In order to get the file back I do: aws s3 cp s3://ronaldoafonso/file.txt file.txt<p>
  <p>Just like that.</p>
  <p>Doesn't it look like an old "cp" command you executed when you were first introduced to the Linux shell?<p>
  <p>Well, it definitely does to me.</p>
  <p>That is it.</p>
  <p>I know it's a short article, but my intention here is just to make you think about where we're heading in the cloud.</p>
