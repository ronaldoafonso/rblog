  <p><h3>Docker Security 1</h3></p>
  <p>Hi.</p>
  <p>This is the first article of a series of articles about Docker security.</p>
  <p>Do you run containers?</p>
  <p>I guess you do.</p>
  <p>If I ask you how secure is your deployment? What would you answer me?</p>
  <p>Do you scan your images before running them on production?</p>
  <p>Do you run your dockerized application as "root"?</p>
  <p>How do you pass sensitive data, like certs and passwords, to your containers? How do you do it?</p>
  <p>Well, these questions and others are what this series of articles is all about.</p>
  <p>As always, stay tuned!</p>
