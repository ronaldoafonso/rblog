  <p>Hi there!</p>
  <p>My name is Ronaldo Afonso.</p>
  <p>I've been working in the Linux and network fields for the last 20 years.</p>
  <p>I first met Linux when I installed an Slackware distro version 3.4.</p>
  <p>I can't even remember exactly when it was, but I would say that it was in 1999.</p>
  <p>At that time, there weren't plenty of documentation as there are today.</p>
  <p>One day a friend of mine just lent me a Linux Magazine with a bundled Slackware CD-ROM.</p>
  <p>So I tried to install it on my computer and guess what? After three months of trying, I did it.</p>
  <p>I've been using Linux since then.</p>
  <p>This blog is about my experience with Linux, network and programming.</p>
  <p>I really hope you enjoy it.</p>
  <p>[]s</p>
