# rblog - Ronaldo Afonso's blog

## What is it?

This is the source code of my blog.

I have decided to build my own blog software instead of using someone else's software for that.

I thought it could be faster and I could learn some new stuff along the way.

So, this code is the result of that work.

## What you will find here?

Here you will find content related to what I've done throughout my journey with computers. Things like:

+ Programming
+ Computer networks
+ Security
+ Linux administration

And maybe others.
