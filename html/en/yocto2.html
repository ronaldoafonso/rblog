  <p><h3>Yocto - Linux Embedded Series 2.</h3></p>
  <p>Hi.</p>
  <p>This is the second article of this series.</p>
  <p>You can find the first one <a href="http://{{.Host}}/{{.Lang}}/yocto1">here</a>.</p>
  <p>In the <a href="http://{{.Host}}/{{.Lang}}/yocto1">last</a> article, I talked about the components of an embedded Linux system.</p>
  <p>Now, it's time to talk about the Yocto project itself.</p>
  <p>So, what is the Yocto project?</p>
  <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto-">Wikipedia</a>, Yocto is the smallest unit prefix in the metric system.</p>
  <p>Ok, but here we're talking about the open source Yocto project, that is, a project intented to help us create a custom Linux-based system for our embedded device.</p>
  <p>The Yocto project provides tools that makes our lives as embedded Linux developers easier when we have to put together all the compoments of an embedded Linux system, like: a toolchain, a bootloader, a kernel, and a root filesystem.</p>
  <p>The thing basically works like this: we inform the Yocto project, through its tools, what we want, like: the kernel configuraion, the hardware architecture of our device, the list of binaries, etc ... and the Yocto project gives us back a Linux system that we can install in our target device.</p>
  <p>That's what we'll be doing during all this series of articles.</p>
  <p>At the end we should have a working device with our customized Linux system.</p>
  <p>Stay tuned!</p>
  <p>[]s</p>
