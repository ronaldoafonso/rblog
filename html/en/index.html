            <p>Hi there!</p>
            <p>How are you?</p>
            <p>I'm Ronaldo Afonso and this is my blog. My intention here is to write about my experience with computer programming, Linux, and network. </p>
            <p>I've been in these fields for more than 25 years and now I decided to share what I've learned during all that time with whoever would be interested.</p>
            <p>My first contact with Linux was when I installed a Slackware distro version 3.4. Well, I can't even remember exactly when it happened, but I guess it was around 1999.</p>
            <p>At that time, there wasn't plenty of documentation as there is today. But one day a friend of mine just lent me a Linux Magazine (have you already heard about that magazine?) with a bundled Slackware CD-ROM. I couldn't wait to try it and so I decided to install it on my home computer.</p>
            <p>Guess what? After three months of hard trying, I did it.</p>
            <p>I've been using Linux since then and I'm very happy with that decision.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy the things I'm going to share with you here.</p>
            <p>See you around.</p>
